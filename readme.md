# Exploring Hyperparameters in Neural Networks

## Project Overview
This mini-project investigates the impact of various hyperparameters on the training, generalization, and performance of artificial neural networks (ANNs). The aim is to understand how different settings influence learning dynamics beyond just achieving high accuracy.

## Dataset
The experiments are conducted using the CIFAR-10 dataset, which is a collection of 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 classes, with 6,000 images per class. The dataset is divided into a training set of 50,000 images and a test set of 10,000 images. The images are stored in a .tar file, which can be downloaded from the official website.
